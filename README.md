STUPID CAT THEME 🐈

Look at him. Look at this absolute unit.

This theme was built for one purpose: to plaster this stupid freaking cat GIF all over your Spotify client.

INSTALLATION (READ THIS OR IT WON'T WORK)

Take the folder containing these files.

Put it in your Spicetify Themes folder.

CRITICAL STEP: You must have the file miau-ezgif.com-resize.gif inside this theme folder. If you lose the cat, you lose the theme.

Open your terminal/powershell.

Run:

spicetify config current_theme StupidCat
spicetify apply


FEATURES

Infinite Cats: The background is just the cat. Over and over again.

Spinning Vinyl: The cover art spins. Why? Because I said so.

High Contrast: Black and white, like the cat's soul.

If you don't like it, change it yourself.
